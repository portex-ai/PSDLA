3. **"Data Provider":** The individual or entity that owns or has rights to the Licensed Data and grants the License under the terms of this Agreement.
4. **"Authorized Users":** Employees, contractors, or agents authorized by the Data Buyer to access and use the Licensed Data solely for the Permitted Uses defined in Section 2.
5. **"Confidential Information":** Any non-public information that is disclosed under this Agreement, including the Licensed Data, technical information, or business information that is either marked or inferred from the Licensed Data, including the dataset itself.
6. **"Platform":** The Portex platform that facilitates the listing, purchase, and delivery of datasets via a User Interface, API, or AI agent.

## 2. Grant of License

### 2.1 Scope of License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and upon receipt of full payment, the Data Provider grants the Data Buyer an exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to access and use the Licensed Data solely for the Permitted Uses set forth below. During the Exclusivity Term defined in Section 11.1, the Data Provider shall not grant any other party a license to use the Licensed Data or sell, distribute, or otherwise make available the Licensed Data to any third party.

### 2.2 Permitted Uses

- **Internal Data Analysis:** The Data Buyer may use the Licensed Data internally to conduct research, analysis, or to derive insights.
